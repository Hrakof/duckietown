1.
	Cloned the daffy branch of the "https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown" repository and added it to the gym-duckietown-daffy folder.

2.
	Installed the dependencies into a virtual environment following the instructions on the gym-duckietown readme.

3.
	Made some minor adjustments so the examples would work and tried out the "gym-duckietown-daffy/manual_control.py".
	https://github.com/Hrakof/duckietown/commit/030419191ea95f81fd4af65b74005cf999784889
    We could manually manoeuvre and test the environment on the streets of Duckietown.

4.
	Created a map to try the "gym-duckietown-daffy/exercises/basic_controls.py" with: gym-duckietown-daffy/custom_maps/my_map.yaml
    We added a custom road, and some Duckie pedestrians on the side as objects. Hitting them, or leaving the track will cause the episode to end.
	The objects were not placed properly with the given coordinates even when using the given examples. This was caused by a scaling issue in the 'simulator.py' file, which we were able to fix. Now objects are placed in correct coordinates.
    
5. 
	Ran the basic_conrols.py with the created map and recorded the result. The recording can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/137RXOOYkt0bW-mpmrr6-S_RW3m2Mequi/view?usp=sharing
	The recording was made with a phone because we could not run the simulation and a recording software at the same time.
