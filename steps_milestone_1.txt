1.
	Cloned the daffy branch of the "https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown" repository and added it to the gym-duckietown-daffy folder.

2.
	Installed the dependencies into a virtual environment following the instructions on the gym-duckietown readme.

3.
	Made some minor adjustments so the examples would work and tried out the "gym-duckietown-daffy/manual_control.py".

4.
	Created a map to try the "gym-duckietown-daffy/exercises/basic_controls.py" with: gym-duckietown-daffy/custom_maps/my_map.yaml
	The objects are not placed properly with the given coordinates even when using the given examples. We could not yet find what causes this error.

5. 
	Ran the basic_conrols.py with the created map and recorded the result. The recording can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/137RXOOYkt0bW-mpmrr6-S_RW3m2Mequi/view?usp=sharing
	The recording was made with a phone because we could not run the simulation and a recording software at the same time.
